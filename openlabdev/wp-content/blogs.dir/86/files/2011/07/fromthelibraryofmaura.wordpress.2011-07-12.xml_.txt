		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm Maura Smale, and I'm an Assistant Professor and the Information Literacy Librarian at <a href="http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/">City Tech</a> (that's New York City College of Technology, <a href="http://www.cuny.edu">CUNY</a>). Find out more about me on <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/members/msmale/profile">my profile</a> on the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu">CUNY Academic Commons</a>.

Library faculty often talk about <strong>information literacy</strong>, but sometimes faculty in other departments aren't familiar with that term. Information literacy is the set of competencies needed to find, evaluate and use information appropriately and ethically. I think of it as research skills + critical thinking, something our students need both for college as well as their careers and lives beyond.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome CUNY library faculty!

That's probably a bit premature -- I'm pretty sure that the librarians registered on the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/">Academic Commons</a> so far are all CAT members.

But I hope to see more CUNY library faculty here soon. The Commons is exactly the sort of collaborative space I've been after for a while now, and I can already think of a host of library groups across the university that could find a place here. I'm the City Tech rep to LILAC, the Library Information Literacy Advisory Council, and while we do meet monthly it would be great to have a resource (beyond the usual email cc: list) for communicating between meetings and sharing our work with our colleagues. I'm also involved in the Library Association of CUNY (LACUNY), and I think that many of our committees and roundtables could take advantage of the tools and spaces on the Commons.

For me the greatest promise of the Commons is the collaboration that's possible here. I'm relatively new to City Tech, and I can't count the number of times this past year when I've wondered, "how do they do that at X?" (where X = another CUNY library). While the CUNY libraries are as different as the individual campuses, we all share a common mission.

In a post last month CAT Chair George Otte <a href="http://purelyreactive.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2009/03/22/something-to-hope-for/">has already mentioned reinventing the wheel</a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many librarians are big fans of open access publishing. There are lots of reasons for this, but that's a post for another day.

This morning I added yet another mark to my academic journals scorecard on the open access side (vs. a closed, subscription-based model). You might have heard <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1891111,00.html">a story in the news</a> a couple of weeks ago that suggested that the use of Facebook by college students is correlated with lower grades. A PhD student at Ohio State University presented the results of this study at the American Educational Research Association meeting in San Diego, the media picked up on the story, and suddenly it was national news.

This week's issue of <em>First Monday</em>, a longstanding open access, peer reviewed journal, includes a <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2498/2181">paper that purports to refute the abovementioned study</a>, a <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2503/2183">response from the OSU researcher</a>, and a <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2504/2187">response from the paper's authors</a>. I highly recommend these articles -- they're a great read.

I know that this is nothing new in science-related fields, in which open access journals facilitate rapid dissemination of research all the time. But this is the first time that I've seen it happen in the non-science disciplines with which I'm much more familiar. And while I admit that I find the refuting research to be more plausible, I'm most excited to see the current discussion and debate over these studies, discussion made possible by the open, accessible nature of the publication format.

Score 1 for open!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week was a big one for higher ed tech and publishing news. As I'm sure everyone's heard by now, <a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3755/blackboard-plans-to-buy-another-rival-angel-learning">Blackboard enveloped yet another of its competitors</a> and <a href="http://prestidigitation.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2009/05/07/new-kindle-textbook-pilot/">Amazon released the new Kindle</a>. I'm kind of happy about the first item -- I tend to agree with the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/07/bb">Twitter comments spotlighted on <em>Inside Higher Ed</em></a> that this move will only feed the anti-Blackboard fires. And while the new Kindle looks promising for textbooks, I admit to being a bit concerned about its high price, esp. for our students @ CUNY.

But the news that really grabbed my attention was the revelation that <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/05/elsevier-and-merck-published-fake.html">Elsevier published a fake journal</a>, the <em>Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine</em>, financed by pharma giant Merck and devoted to shilling for Merck products. It's not the first time something like this has happened, and I'm sure it won't be the last.

This news is depressing for many reasons, but the pedagogical implications are uppermost in my mind right now. One of my responsibilities as a library professor is to try and strengthen our students' information literacy: finding sources for their coursework, evaluating and selecting the most appropriate sources, and using those sources ethically (think plagiarism + copyright). For many of their papers and projects students are required to use scholarly journal articles, and I try to spend as much time as I can in a library session unpacking the differences between scholarly journals and newspapers/magazines and explaining peer review. And in many ways fake journals, like high-profile plagiarism cases, just make it harder to convince students to value the scholarly literature for their coursework.

On the other hand, at least <a href="http://info-fetishist.org/2009/05/03/pay-no-attention-to-all-that-money-behind-the-curtain/">one librarian</a> has pointed out that perhaps we can use this depressing revelation as a teachable moment. So I guess I'll add it to the list of <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/pranksters-spoof-the-times/">strange/scary-but-true cases</a> that we can use to emphasize the importance of digging a little deeper, paying attention and critical thinking.]]></content:encoded>

I think we'll have to use this in different ways when teaching students in various stages of their college careers. For the intro classes, maybe just mentioning it as a cautionary tale, something to underscore the need for critical evaluation of sources. But for more advanced classes I think that triangulation of sources could work. Apparently several of the articles in the "journal" were reprinted from other journals, which is pretty fishy. Also I think that really scrutinizing the references and checking for authors' affiliations could be valuable in these cases.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I try to keep up with research and news on how teenagers use technology (or not), because of course today's teens are tomorrow's undergraduates, and it's useful for me to have some knowledge of where they come from before they walk through the library doors. 

I'm a big fan of danah boyd's work on teens and social networking -- her (<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>-licensed!) <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/TakenOutOfContext.pdf">dissertation</a> (pdf link) is on my Summer Reading list this year. A couple of weeks ago she tweeted that she was about to head to Atlanta to do some fieldwork, and did anyone have any questions for the kids? I couldn't resist and fired off an information literacy/media literacy question.

Last weekend boyd posted <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/05/16/answers_to_ques.html">a few quick reflections</a> on her blog about the questions she asked and how the teens had responded, and I was pleased to find that the question I'd asked made the cut! Apologies for the shameless self-promotion, but the Q&amp;A and comments are really quite interesting (even without my question).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I swear that this isn't going to turn into Maura's Copyright Blog, but a couple of copyright-ish things have crossed my desk(top) recently and it seemed selfish not to share:

1. A coalition of student groups across the U.S. recently released the <a href="http://righttoresearch.org/">Student Statement on The Right to Research</a>. The statement asserts that "scholarly knowledge is part of the common wealth of humanity," and argues for open access to scholarly research (as opposed to a subscription-based model for journal publishing). It's great to see students involved in the open access movement. The footnotes on the statement feature lots of great reads, too.

2. I'm sure many have seen this already, but just in case not, here's marketing guru Seth Godin's <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/06/textbook-rant.html">rant against the high prices of college textbooks</a>. A quick, punchy read (just like you'd expect from a marketer), and it's hard to disagree with him, too. I'd add an admittedly obvious note to the list of impracticalities: when libraries buy textbooks (as we may do since it can be difficult for our students to afford them), we're left with "expired" content when the next edition is published as well as the need to buy the new edition.

3. This week's <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/ipod/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218000206">Information Week has an article</a> about a recent <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/09-132.pdf">paper out of the Harvard Business School</a> that attempts to unpack the complexities of copyright protection and the entertainment industry. The authors suggest that, while sales have fallen over the past decade, the number of new works (music, film, books) being produced has actually risen, as have revenues from ancillary streams like concerts. Thus, they conclude that file-sharing "has not discouraged creative artists from producing new works."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My iPhone recently celebrated its first birthday, and I've been reflecting on how it's changed my information and communication habits. Last summer I upgraded from a regular old dumbphone, so I didn't have any prior experience with Blackberries et al. I should also mention that I am not a heavy phone user--talking on the phone is probably my least favorite way to communicate. I was an AT&amp;T subscriber before getting an iPhone so specifics of the phone service don't have much of an impact on me, either, though I was pleased to discover that phone calls on the 3G network sound better than on my old phone.

I love my iPhone and will never go back to just any old phone. Here are my top iPhone uses (in reverse order, because it's more suspenseful):

<b>4. Google Maps</b>
Combined with the phone's built-in GPS, Google Maps is a powerful tool that I rely on constantly to get around the city and on trips out of town. The first time the iPhone helped us route around the perpetually-heinous traffic on the Staten Island Expressway I nearly wept tears of joy.

<b>3. Music</b>
This one will be more obvious and less interesting when I reveal that I only had a tiny iPod Shuffle before getting my iPhone, so it's still somewhat novel for me to carry around a device with ca. 6gb of music/podcasts. Using Pandora to create custom streaming radio stations is fun, too.

<b>2. Internet</b>
The entire internet in one small device, what could be better? From checking the weather forecast to finding information to answer questions both frivolous and serious, I use the internet on my phone throughout the day. My 7-yr-old now refuses to wait until we're home to find the answers he seeks, instead demanding: "look it up on your phone, Mom."

<b>1. Reading</b>
In retrospect, my biggest surprise is how much time I spend reading on my iPhone. It's true that much of my reading is internet-related; my daily rounds include Twitter, Google Reader for my RSS feeds, and the <em>New York Times</em>. But what shocks me is how much other reading I do on the iPhone, even reading (gasp!) <i>books</i>. I'd never been able to get into reading an ebook on the computer, but now I realize that's more about location than technology. I can read on the iPhone anyplace I'd take a physical book. And since I'm one of those people who breaks into a cold sweat at the thought of being stuck somewhere without anything to read, having 37 books in my pocket is an enormous relief. As I'm typing this it occurs to me that having an iPhone has probably increased the amount of reading I do on a daily basis, too.

Just to balance things out, here are the top uses I <i>expected</i> for my iPhone that haven't been as important as I'd anticipated:

<b>3. Games</b>
I do play games on the phone--obsessions have included Subway and Flight Control--but not as much as I thought I would. I'm an avid gamer and had hoped that the iPhone would let me play more often, since I never can seem to find the time for them lately. I guess the big stumbling block has been my hesitation to buy new games (which probably means that what I really want is more time to play the games that I already have in other formats).

<b>2. Task Management</b>
I was a huge Palm/Visor geek back in the day, and utterly devoted to the multiple to-do lists I maintained on the PDA. There's no native listmaking software on the iPhone and while I know there are many apps out there I haven't gotten around to finding one that I like. I've actually gone back to using a paper to-do list--hopelessly retro, I know, but it works for me right now.

<b>1. Email</b>
While I do use the phone for email, I've settled into a pattern of checking email on the phone but waiting until I have access to a real computer to reply. I blame my butterfingers with the soft keyboard which slows down my input speed. I'm sure I'd get better with practice but right now I'm in a chicken-and-egg frustration loop. Now that the current OS supports the landscape-style keyboard in the email app I plan to make more of an effort to get my iPhone thumbs up to speed.

I've also started thinking more about smartphone use in libraries and education (which seems messy enough to me now that I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it), but that's a post for another day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been at City Tech for just over 18 months now, and I'm definintely settled in to the library, college and university. But lately I feel like I'm living psychologist Barry Schwartz's book <i>The Paradox of Choice</i>. It's a fascinating book (and a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html">great TED talk</a>, too) that explores how we feel when there are an overwhelming number of choices available to us. He offers lots of consumer-related examples like baby strollers and televisions.

But I feel the pull of too many options when I look at everything going on at City Tech and CUNY. There are so many interesting lectures, workshops, film screenings, and conferences throughout the semester. Of course there's no time to do it all (though I'm trying to convince my almost-8-yr-old to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Twister-Journal-Cardboard-Genius/dp/1554532310/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1254000955&amp;sr=8-2">build me a time machine</a> anyway).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I taught two library sessions for two introductory composition classes with the same professor and the same assignment on the same day. I love it when the schedule serendipitously works out to make that happen, in part because it gives me the chance to informally evaluate my teaching: both what I tend to cover and how I structure those  sessions.

I’ve struggled over the past few years to move away from me standing at the front of the class talking talking talking so I can increase the amount of time for students to work on their own research during the library session. Students are supposed to come to the session having already selected a topic for their research assignment (though not all of them do, of course). I try to spend no more than 10-15 minutes each discussing and demonstrating internet research, the library catalog, and article databases, interspersed with 10-15 minute chunks of time for students to search on their own while I circulate to answer questions and offer suggestions.

Our class sessions are 75 minutes long — this is a lot to do in 75 minutes. I’ve tried to work around those constraints by seriously abbreviating my demo, and looking for ways to interject more information while students search on their own. For example, I won’t mention that spelling counts or talk about the difference between keywords and subject headings in a catalog search, but when a student asks me how to revise a search when she hasn’t retrieved any results, I’ll answer her question so the whole class can hear.

Sometimes, though, the class is quiet and the students don’t ask many questions. In these cases I always feel somewhat strange: I walk around the room a bit, but I don’t want to pace back and forth like an old-fashioned school marm monitoring an exam. I check in with the students who look like they’re lost (or facebooking), but that can be hard to do with students who don’t seem interested in my help, and some of them are genuinely, quietly doing their work. Sometimes I stand in front of the class fiddling with the computer or looking at my lesson plan, but that feels conspicuous, like I’m somehow shirking my teacherly duties. This is what happened in the second class I taught last week, and it’s awkward.

But sometimes the less talk more search strategy works really well, which also happened last week. In the first class students were talkative and interested, volunteering answers to my questions during the demos and spending time on their own searches in between. However, there was a wide range of student preparation for the assignment in this class, with some students still working to narrow down a topic and others ready to go. Additionally, several students came to the session with obvious prior experience searching for sources for academic work. In this case I was able to give each student a small amount of personalized attention, which let me suggest topic narrowing strategies to some and advanced Google searching to others.

I chatted with the course professor after both classes who mentioned that in her experience the afternoon class is just a quieter group of students overall (I’d originally suspected post-lunch digestive sleepiness). But it’s still a challenge — what’s the right balance of talking and search time? Will I ever be able to shake that weird awkward feeling while students search and I just stand there? What are some other ways that I can encourage students to open up and ask the questions that I suspect they have?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Perhaps you saw the article in last week's Chronicle of Higher Ed about <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/After-Losing-Users-in/48588">the difficulties of searching library catalogs</a>. No? Librarians have been chatting about it all week. I've been chewing over it too, and finally have time to get down some comments.

It's true that many library catalogs and article databases have poorly-designed user interfaces, I absolutely won't argue with that. And it's very frustrating, both as a librarian and a user. However, the article seems to muddle a few different issues.

The article begins with the story of a graduate student who's had trouble finding books on Thomas Jefferson. I have to admit that I'm a bit mystified by a few things:

1. Online library catalogs provide keyword searching, but they also allow searching by title, author, or subject. My guess is that if the student had searched for Jefferson by subject, her search would have been successful. Of course, with the ubiquity of the internet everyone has become more accustomed to keyword searching (including librarians). But, frankly, a keyword search of Thomas Jefferson on the internet also wouldn't produce the results that this grad student needs (umm, Wikipedia?). As librarians, we need to remind our users that for simple questions, simple internet searches will usually suffice, but more complex information needs will require more complex search strategies.

2. Books in libraries are organized by subject, just as are books in bookstores. Of course librarians assign call numbers to books to catalog and organize them, but the call numbers are arranged by subject; thus library stacks can be browsed in the same way as at bookstores. Maybe we also need to remember to emphasize that to our users. At my library we have neat bookmarks with the Library of Congress call number ranges printed on them that we can pass these out to students at the reference desk -- I need to remind myself to do that more often.

3. Article databases can be particularly difficult to use, especially for novice searchers. Database interfaces are complex, and it's confusing to students that there are so many different interfaces to learn to use. This is a direct result of the economic and production history of scholarly journal publishing, but knowing this doesn't make the reality of searching article databases any easier. Yes, new products can search across multiple databases and the library catalog at the same time (called federated searching), but they can be clunky to use. And they're usually expensive, too.

I'm excited about new solutions coming down the pike, but (like some of the commenters on the Chron's piece) I'm hesitant to believe that one, magical, Google-style search box <em>should</em> be the utopian goal for academic libraries. Scholarly information is complex. It's text, images, data, audio, video, some "traditionally" published and some not so much, and it's in all sorts of places on the internet: free, paid, and in-between. It would certainly save us a lot of time if we had a search engine sophisticated enough to find the scholarly info we need amongst all of the billions of pages non-scholarly content on the internet. But isn't searching an important part of the scholarly process? Doesn't it help us refine our questions and discover new areas of interest?

Or maybe it's just that I <i>like</i> searching. Which, I suppose, is why I'm a librarian.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month for <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org">Open Access Week</a> our library hosted a program on OA scholarly journal publishing for faculty, complete with <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/buy-oa-week-merchandise-here/">spiffy orange buttons</a> (suitable for Halloween wearing, too!). It was a great discussion, but since <a href="http://acrlog.org/2009/10/27/celebrating-open-access-week/">I've written about it elsewhere</a> I won't repeat it here.

I've found myself mulling over open access off and on ever since. Most of the time when I think about OA publishing it's about academic journals, but of course publishing's not a monolith. There are lots of materials relevant to academic work that are published in traditional ways, and there will likely be different models needed to successfully convert them to OA.

<strong>Scholarly Journals:</strong>
Discussion about journals seems to make up most of the conversation about open access scholarly publishing, and in some ways it's the easiest transformation to imagine. Partly that's because there are already longstanding examples of well-respected, peer-reviewed OA scholarly journals (yes, <a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/">First Monday</a>, I'm looking at you). But I also think that the economics of scholarly journal publishing favor open access in the long run. It's an old saw that bears repeating: as scholars, we are compensated by our institutions for responsibilities that include performing original research (often funded by grants which we must work to acquire), writing up and disseminating the results of that research, and serving as peer-reviewers and editors of scholarly journals. In the traditional publishing model we then give our copyright away to the publishers, who sell those journals back to our libraries. Our institutions pay <em>twice</em> for the results of our research.

There are a number of different funding models for open access scholarly journals. University and college presses or libraries can host journals using the free and open source Open Journal Systems. Journals might also charge author fees; researchers can apply for grant funding to defray the fees or institutions can subsidize these costs for their faculty. Many open access journals are currently published using one of these models, and I'm sure the number will only increase.

<strong>Textbooks:</strong>
Open access textbooks are a little trickier, though I'm a big proponent of them for a variety of reasons. Textbooks are incredibly expensive, both for students and for libraries. We buy a fair number of textbooks in my library and it's so frustrating to have to get new editions every few years which may not even be all that different from the old editions (but of course we have to buy the edition that faculty are using).

Open access textbook/course material repositories are springing up all over the internet recently, definitely a positive development. I know that many faculty write textbooks and derive some income from them. But I think there's more to be gained by sharing our curricular materials, especially at public universities. Freely-available textbook modules could be peer reviewed, and the community of researchers could discuss and refine them. I think the <a href="http://oerconsortium.org/">Community College Consortium for Open Educational Resources</a> says it best: "When educators pool their expertise to create a culture of shared knowledge, everyone benefits."

<strong>Scholarly Monographs:</strong>
Many of the same publication issues for textbooks also apply to scholarly books, especially in that researchers do profit from their sale. But many monographs don't have a huge print run, and university and other scholarly presses have felt the squeeze of tightened budgets recently, too.

A hybrid print/digital model might be a good strategy for scholarly monographs. Earlier this year the University of Michigan and the Open Humanities Press <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/New-Open-Access-Monograph/7613/">announced a partnership</a> to publish a series of scholarly monographs. Digital versions of the books will be freely available online, but paperback versions will also be available for sale. Recent advances in print-on-demand technology makes this distribution model much more feasible than previously.

Ultimately I'm in favor of open access for most academic materials. As a researcher, I'm eager for lots of other scholars to read my work. As a public employee, I'm sensitive to the fact that taxpayer money helps pay my salary. And as a teacher, I'd like my students to have access to a wide range of quality information from many sources. Open access publishing encourages the dissemination of scholarship to the widest possible audience, to the great benefit of researchers, students, and the public.]]></content:encoded>

It's been fantastic -- while it's a small class, the students are dedicated and we've had some great discussions so far about how information is produced and distributed.

One of the best things about teaching a semester length course (as opposed to single class sessions) is the luxurious amount of time we have to explore the landscape of information. I have the space to devote an entire class to traditional print media, another to digital text, another to non-text media, etc. I've also been able to do something I always want to do in the one-shots: bring in different examples of print media for discussion.

Over the past two weeks I've brought an academic journal, newspaper, popular magazine, trade journal, and three zines on different subjects (music, parenting and librarianship) to class. I've long felt that it's confusing to undergraduates when they're confronted with article databases in which everything looks the same. Even on the internet, it can be hard to read visual clues other than advertising (which can sometimes be very subtle, too). The differences between the content in different types of publications are much more obvious when you can hold and flip through them.

It was also amazing to learn how much my students appreciate the physical embodiment of these different media. Most of the students in my class are of traditional college age, the so-called "millennial" generation. While I don't necessarily buy a lot of the digital natives hype (based on my own experiences as well as <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Generational-Myth/32491">others'</a>), the truth is that all of us, me included, are probably heavier users of digital media these days. One student lamented that he missed browsing in music stores for CDs, and other revealed that he didn't like buying MP3s because there wasn't anything physical with the purchase.

Next week we start talking about some big meaty information issues: ethics, privacy, access and preservation. I can't wait to see what insights the students bring to those discussions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For a while now I've been thinking on a post about using WordPress for the course I'm teaching this semester, but have been too busy to get to it. Then this past week saw a post along the same lines from <a href="http://www.profhacker.com/2010/03/18/wordpress-a-better-lms/">David Parry over at Prof Hacker</a>, with extensive comments by CUNY's own Joe Ugoretz, who has blogged about <a href="http://prestidigitation.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">using WordPress in his online course this semester</a> right here on the Commons. What could I possibly have to add to these great, detailed posts and comments?

Well, I'm here to give a plug for the humble old freely-hosted course site/blog on WordPress.com. My course is fully face-to-face, so I don't need many of the customizations that others use for their courses. And while I do admit to a bit of envy re: integrating gradebook functionality, especially, I've been pleasantly surprised at how well my course site has worked this semester. Importantly, it took a minimum of time and tech skills to set up, and is easy and fast to maintain. While it's true that I had used WordPress before this semester, none of my students had, and they were expert bloggers after the very first class.

Why use the free version of WordPress? For me it mostly came down to economics: I didn't want to shell out to buy a new domain. (I have a personal website and server space, but didn't want to host something work-related on that domain.) I also didn't want to spend the time on a custom WP install during the intersession. This is my first semester teaching a credit-bearing course in a while, and I had lots to do to prep the course in January.

My course site--<a href="http://lib1201.wordpress.com">LIB 1201 Research &amp; Documentation for the Information Age</a>--was set up in about an hour, not including creating the custom header graphic (and obsessing over which template to use). WordPress allows for both Posts (i.e., the traditional blog functionality) and Pages. My students are required to blog, so I left the Front Page of the site to use for their blog posts and announcements from me (tagged "announcements" so they can be found easily from the tag cloud on the sidebar). Then I created four Pages:

1. Syllabus: I made a traditional paper version of the syllabus to hand out on the first day, with the usual course requirements, policies, schedule, readings, etc. Everything from the syllabus <i>except</i> the readings is on this page. Bonus functionality: when the schedule has, inevitably, had to change a bit, I've been able to post updates.

2. Blogging Guidelines and 3. Assignments: Since their blog posts and comments are a fairly substantial part of their grade for the course (20%), I wanted to give my students detailed guidelines and a grading rubric. And while a brief description of all course assignments is on the syllabus, as the due date for each approaches I've posted more detailed information about each assignment, too.

4. Readings: This page lists all of the readings for the course. I am using a short textbook, but most of the readings are either freely available on the internet or accessible to students in our library's subscription databases. Using the permalink feature in the databases I'm able to link to those articles directly from this page. I'm so pleased to be able to link to almost everything we're reading this semester right from the course site (as opposed to the hours I spent in college waiting in line to buy coursepacks at the local copyshop).

This setup has worked swimmingly so far. I might change things around some next semester -- maybe a dedicated announcements page would be handy? I've been adding links to websites we discuss in class to my delicious (tagged "lib1201"), which I've linked on the sidebar as "Additional Resources," and maybe I could pipe the RSS feed for those links right into the site at some point. But for now I'm happy with my course site. And while I'm still using a plain old spreadsheet for their grades, I've subscribed to the course blog posts and comments in my feedreader, so I always know when my students submit their blogging homework.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately I've been thinking about how students, faculty, and librarians use academic libraries. It all started last month after the latest <a href="http://www.ithaka.org/ithaka-s-r/research/faculty-surveys-2000-2009/Faculty%20Study%202009.pdf">Ithaka Faculty Survey</a> results were released. Many survey responses seem to indicate that faculty use of academic libraries is decreasing. Of course there was much discussion of the report all over the higher ed (the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Scholars-Increasingly-Embrace/64982">Chronicle</a> and <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/04/07/survey">IHE</a>) and library (<a href="http://acrlog.org/2010/04/07/latest-ithaka-study-on-faculty-a-small-step-forward/">ACRLog</a> and <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6725623.html">Library Journal</a>) bloglands.

I read these articles with interest but not surprise. In my past life when I was in graduate school for archaeology I was a heavy library user, but it was while working with my advisor that I learned about the major scholars in my field of specialty. I mined the bibliographies of the articles and books assigned for my courses, searched the library catalog for books, and browsed the stacks in the call number ranges for the subjects I researched. I belonged to the scholarly societies for archaeology and anthropology (and got their journals), and sometimes I browsed the table of contents in other relevant journals in the library's current periodicals section. To be honest, I don't think I ever consulted with a librarian at my university's library the entire time I was in graduate school.

I suspect that my process from many years ago is not all that different from the ways faculty and graduate students do informational research today. It's so much easier to use online indexes that I'm sure researchers search their specialized databases, but they do so with preexisting knowledge of their field, both the vocabulary of their subject matter and the major players in their discipline. However, as others have noted (e.g., <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/04/07/survey">William Badke's comment on IHE</a>), students approach information-based research for their coursework very differently. They don't usually have deep knowledge of the disciplines and topics that they're researching, and they don't know the prominent scholars or publications. Many students, especially freshmen, are also unfamiliar with library databases and even physical libraries.

Since the faculty research process doesn't necessarily include librarians, that's likely one reason why faculty see the library more as an information storehouse and less as a location for academic consultation. But our students really do need help to learn to make sense of the information landscape and do research successfully. It can be difficult for experienced researchers--both faculty and librarians--to put ourselves back into the novice researcher mindset of our students. Information literacy instruction can help students learn to do information-based research for their courses and to begin to evolve into more advanced researchers.

Of course, there's a huge variety of academic institutions, and variety in their libraries as well. I'm at a college library and coordinate our instruction and information literacy program, so working with students is always on my mind. But there's also some good news out there as a counterpoint to the Ithaka study. Barbara Fister just published the results of her <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6726948.html">survey of academic administrators</a> and found that they all value the library for a wide variety of reasons. And while many mentioned that academic libraries will continue to change and evolve in the future, none envisioned them disappearing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The information landscape has changed dramatically in the past two decades. It sounds hackneyed and idealistic, but the ability to research and use information in a critical, well-considered way is a life skill that's increasingly valuable. Our students need to be able to deal with these changes and navigate information resources, even (especially!) those students who aren’t going on to graduate school.

Information literacy is the term used by librarians and others in higher ed to describe these competencies. We teach information literacy to students in many different settings: at the Reference Desk, in one-on-one appointments, via online tutorials and guides, and in “one-shot” library workshops, to name just a few. While there is evidence that these instructional strategies are useful for students, many librarians feel frustrated that our interactions don’t afford us enough time to address much more than the most basic information skills.

There is another way: the information literacy course. With the luxury of a full semester of classes, instructors can work with students to explore the lifecycle of information in depth. Questions for framing the course might include:

<ul><li>Where does information come from, how is it produced, and by whom?</li>

<li>Why are some information sources privileged and respected while others are not?</li>

<li>How can we negotiate complex information issues like access, preservation, privacy, and ethical use?</li>

<li>How is information organized (and who does the organizing)?</li>

<li>How can we develop strategies for searching and finding relevant information?</li>

<li>Why do we evaluate the quality of information? Should we?</li>

<li>What are the reasons for documentation and dissemination of information?</li>

<li>What role does information play in our lives, in college and beyond?</li>

<li>What is the future of information?</li></ul>

This is not a library skills class. We do not spend 15 weeks teaching undergraduates how to act like librarians. Yes, we teach students how to use the online library catalog and databases, but that’s far from our primary goal. In these courses we have the time to encourage thoughtful engagement by students with a wide variety of information and media, as both content producers and consumers.

What could an information literacy course look like? I taught one recently, and during the course we:

- Contrasted publishing in traditional print media like newspapers, magazines, books and scholarly journals, with digital publishing in all forms, from text to audiovisual media.

- Examined and experimented with the opportunities and challenges of participatory media through our interactions both in class and on our course blog, which was openly available on the internet.

- Used our discussion of complex information issues to shape each student's development of a topic to explore in depth via a research proposal, annotated bibliography, and research paper.

- Investigated the mechanics of information organization in print and digital media, both human-generated and machine-based systems, and experimented with tagging as a classification tool for our course content.

- Applied our knowledge of classification systems to create strategies for searching various information sources successfully. One student remarked that she knew she'd found the most appropriate keywords to use to search for information when she discovered an article on nearly her exact research topic.

- Obtained information on students' research topics from scholarly, journalistic, and general internet sources, analyzed this information, and presented the results in a research paper.

- Collaborated in pairs to synthesize the results of each student's research topic, and used an online publishing tool to share the findings. Students chose wikis and blogs for this project and used these spaces in ways that exceeded the requirements of the assignment, for example, to communicate with each other and share notes and resources while the project was in progress.

- Analyzed and documented the process of working on the collaborative project, and presented both the project and documentation to the rest of the class for discussion.

The library doesn't hold a monopoly on information literacy, of course. Similar work to what's covered in this course happens in other courses and other departments as well. But information literacy competencies must develop and strengthen over time, and a course can provide our students with a solid foundation on which to build. An information literacy course can help our students hack the new information landscape and prepare for the future.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been reflecting on this too and this is really helpful in moving my thinking along - a lot.

I started from the point of considering how you could help adult learners, not students.  On the basis that they had fewer information skills and needed the help, I wanted to put together a basic toolkit for them to establish their own PLN.
http://medialiteracyni.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/crossing-the-digital-divide-a-basic-kit-for-the-adult-learner/ 


I realised this was a fallacy early on.  The difference between adult learners and students is that the former know what they don't know and lack confidence, while the latter confuse using the tech with knowing how to use it for learning.  Their confidence in their own skills is misplaced.  

Then one of our LIM students, who works  for a university careers service,  told us that the careers service delivered a compulsory accredited module to all students.  Why on earth don't we do the same?  It's so obvious that it is needed and that libraries and library schools can develop and deliver the content.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, Maura. If you ask an acoustician or an ethnomusicologist what one needs to know to understand (among other things) sound and culture, s/he might prefer giving you a monochord, a tuning fork, or a birimbau rather than an explanation. *Doing* taps into something that is a combination of play, curiosity and creation -- ontologizing (?) the actual development of knowledge. I fully enjoy your explication of the course process, trying to develop fluency with information -- in a  digital world that now gives us the ability to create and produce. This is where I'd like to see us go -- students can create archives, deeply mine primary texts, produce media, visualize history, become cartographers and make myriad associations that can break down this bifurcation between mind and knowledge. The affordances of digital culture -- skill level and age notwithstanding -- are what I see worthy of exploration here.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments, Anne and Randal. 

Anne, you make a great point about traditional-age college students and adult learners. We have many students at my college who have returned to college after years in the workplace (as well as those who are fresh out of high school), and it's an interesting challenge to address the information literacy needs of both. Actually in my course this past semester there was a fairly wide age spread, and I think our work was richer for it.

Randal, I completely agree with you that our students need the opportunity to work as creators and producers. It was so gratifying to be able to provide that opportunity in my course. And the students really seemed to enjoy the work they did, too.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Maura,

This was a fascinating read and the course seems not only essential but the beginning of something that I hope will worm its way down the educational rabbit hole over time, attempting to generate a system in which information literacy is imparted as early - suddenly I think perhaps I should have posed this to you as a question rather than a hypothesis - as middle school, or maybe even earlier than that, given that most kids these days learn how to use the internet before they reach middle school age (at least in some minimal, supervised capacity).

Pretending I asked a question, what do you think are the chances that we'll see this kind of a development occur?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Tim, thanks for your comment.

While I'm not as familiar with K-12 education as with post-secondary, I do think the beginnings of internet/media literacy instruction is happening in some schools. And K-12 librarians are teaching it and publishing about it too, at least those districts that are lucky enough to still have funding for libraries and librarians.

But I think that information literacy needs to be much more formally integrated into the pre-college curriculum (which sounds a bit like authoring my own demise!) It would be ideal if students got to college with at least the beginnings of a solid understanding about where "stuff" on the internet comes from and how it can be used. I wonder if the publicity generated recently about the privacy concerns with Facebook (to take just one example) could help push IL into K-12 ed?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Maura,

Thanks for the information...I'll trust you're a reliable source :-)

It's true that the publicity that Facebook has received may have helped add to the uncertainty inherent to internet fact sharing and I don't doubt that the feelings of insecurity with regard to Facebook represent a doubt infused energy that will be redirected, by certain skillful and opportunistic educators and parents, toward enlightening younger web users (and TV watchers!) as to the importance of examining information with a critical eye. 

...But I don't see information literacy education developing so rapidly as to put you out of a job, due to fiscal restraints and - of course, and ever ironically - the perennial problem of transforming education despite those who, because education hadn't yet transformed when they were educated, adamantly oppose educational transformation!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By now everyone's probably heard about the storm a'brewing in scholarly publishing this week. I don't want to repeat what's been very ably said in many other spaces on the internets, but as an open access advocate I couldn't let the week end without at least collecting together some of the high points of the discussion.

In brief, the University of California system libraries are resisting outrageous price increases for the Nature Publishing Group's scholarly journals. This situation is, sadly, a familiar one for academic librarians, and this is not the first time that a large consortial group has pushed back. What's new is the scope of the resistance: unless NPG comes down in price, U Cal faculty are being asked (among other things) to decline to peer review or submit articles to NPG journals.

This is <b>huge</b>, and a huge step in the right direction. As a librarian, a faculty member and a researcher I am absolutely thrilled to see this happening, and I'll be following the situation closely as it evolves.

Here are some great places to go for more info:

<ul><li>The <i>Chronicle of Higher Ed</i>'s article <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-California-Tries-Just/65823/">U. of California Tries Just Saying No to Rising Journal Costs</a> provides a thorough introduction to the boycott.</li>
<br />

<li>Dorothea Salo, Institutional Repository Librarian at the University of Wisconsin who writes a fantastic blog about scholarly communication and open access (among other things) over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bookoftrogool/">The Book of Trogool</a>, has been covering the story since early in the week. (It was actually a tweet from Salo that first tipped me off to this situation late Tuesday night.)</li>
<br />

<li>Bethany Nowviskie, Director of Digital Research &amp; Scholarship at the University of Virginia Library, wrote a great post called <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2010/fight-club-soap/">Fight Club Soap</a> that, among other things, includes a powerful discussion of the relationship between scholarly journal pricing and scholarly monograph publication.</li></ul>

Good stuff, all. Go read it!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I was disappointed to have to miss the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/groups/games-teaching-and-learning/">CUNY Games Network</a>'s final meeting of the year. Sounds like Frank Crocco's Gaming Your Syllabus workshop and Andrew Boyarsky's demo of his game Who Wants to Save the Planet were both fun and useful.

I wasn't completely ignoring games on June 4th, though. I spent the day at the <a href="http://www.acrlnec.org/sigs/nelig/2010/index.html">annual program</a> of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) New England Library Instruction Group (NELIG) up in Connecticut. The NELIG conference was devoted specifically to library instruction and information literacy, and I heard lots of great presentations (<a href="http://acrlog.org/2010/06/12/a-full-day-of-information-literacy/">I wrote up some of the highlights here</a>). Keynoter John Palfrey (Vice Dean for Library and Information Resources at Harvard Law School and co-author of <i>Born Digital</i>) shared a very interesting piece of game-related info: their research revealed that gaming is one thread that connects and joins teens across socioeconomic statuses.

But the main reason I headed up to the conference is that I was a presenter. I spoke about a low-tech classroom game I've been developing and implementing over the past semester called Quality Counts, which is designed to help students learn how to evaluate internet sources. I was tickled to learn afterward that <a href="http://www.acrlnec.org/neligblog/2010/06/04/live-from-nelig-quality-counts-so-does-low-tech-for-games/">my talk was liveblogged</a> (and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/msmale/smale-nelig2010">my slides are available here</a>).

Of course the inspiration for this game came from a <a href="http://cunygames.wordpress.com/">CUNY Games Network</a> meeting, and it was great to have the chance to discuss the group as well as my game. After my presentation I chatted with several folks who wanted to learn more about us (and who seemed a bit envious, to be honest!). One of the things I find most inspiring about Games Network meetings is the opportunity to connect with other faculty and staff across the university to discuss using games in teaching and learning. I never fail to come away from our meetings with fresh ideas for my own teaching.

So while I was sad to miss the meeting, I was pleased to have the opportunity to speak about my game and about the CUNY Games Network. And I'm looking forward to getting back to our meetings again in the fall.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s that time again -- the new academic year has begun, and many of our libraries’ article databases have unveiled interface changes. There are usually a couple of these each fall, but I think this year is somewhat unusual in that three of the biggies have redesigned:

1. EBSCO, including Academic Search Complete
2. LexisNexis, the news and law database
3. JSTOR, the full-text database of scholarly journals across the arts and sciences

I’d wager that these three databases together probably capture the lion’s share of our undergraduates’ searches -- if not in total then at least their first attempts at finding information on their research topics. I haven’t had time to fully explore the changes, though I did take a brief spin through each database.

At first glance the EBSCO changes look fairly minor. In their last redesign they added an incredibly useful feature -- a pop-up bubble that displays an article’s abstract from the results list -- so I’m predisposed to feel positive about this redesign.

On the results list, all of the options that can be used to refine results have been moved to the left side of the page (previously they were split between left and right columns). I’d guess this will make it much easier for students to use these options.

<a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/ebsco1.jpg"><img src="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/ebsco1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="303" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-248" /></a>

Another nice new feature is that once you click through to the article detail page, the links to use to print, save, email, etc. the article appear in the right column under the Tools menu.

<a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/ebsco2.jpg"><img src="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/ebsco2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-249" /></a>

Of course these are only a few of the changes, but I’d like to point out just one more that I like: in the top navigation bar the Thesaurus link now reads Subject Terms. The less time librarians have to spend explaining library jargon, the better (IMHO).

I’ve always disliked the LexisNexis interface so my hopes were not high for this redesign. So I was pleased to see that the changes have made LexisNexis much easier to use.

<a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/lexisnexis.jpg"><img src="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/lexisnexis.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-244" /></a>

While the Easy Search page looks a bit busy, most students will probably get the most use out of the Search the News box. And the news search from this page is much, much better than it used to be. It’s streamlined, and with far fewer choices it is far less confusing. An advanced search with more fields and limiters is just one click away on the All News page.

Most importantly, the News search now defaults to all available dates. Previously the default date range was only the prior two months, and the dropdown menu to change this option was all the way at the bottom of the page and very easy to miss.

I’m still not a big fan of the LexisNexis results or article displays (why are the icon links for printing/saving/emailing so incredibly tiny?), but the search redesign is definitely a step in the right direction.

And then there’s JSTOR. JSTOR caused quite a stir late last month when their interface changes were unveiled. Briefly: when the redesign launched, the search results defaulted to displaying articles from <b>all</b> publications archived by JSTOR. While this doesn’t sound like a problem in theory, in practice not all libraries subscribe to all JSTOR collections. The kicker is that initially JSTOR didn’t enable OpenURL, which allows libraries to link between databases. This meant that search results were potentially returning lots of articles that <i>could</i> be available in another database, except there was no way to link over to them. 

Lots of librarians cried foul when they realized the scope of these changes, and you may have seen the article at <a href="//www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/08/26/jstor”">Inside Higher Ed</a> and several blog posts (<a href="//meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/2010/08/24/whats-the-deal-jstor/”">here</a> and <a href="//acrlog.org/2010/08/24/new-and-improved-or-not/”">here</a>, to name just two) about the kerfluffle. And luckily JSTOR responded pretty quickly, so OpenURL has been enabled.

<a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/jstor1.jpg"><img src="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/jstor1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="343" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-250" /></a>

Other than the linking issues, I think the JSTOR interface changes are great. Again, I’d never been fond of their previous interface – I found it deceptively simple with just the one field for search terms, and the Advanced Search always seemed overly confusing. The new interface still has just one field, but with the addition of Browse By Discipline links that make it easier to drill down to a specific journal or quickly scan the journals available in each subject.

<a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/jstor2.jpg"><img src="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/jstor2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="388" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-251" /></a>

The Advanced Search also seems streamlined and easier to use. Again there’s the option to limit by discipline or individual journal, which seems like it will be really useful for beginning students who may get far too many results if they search across all disciplines.

These redesigns will definitely change the way I teach students how to use EBSCO databases, LexisNexis and JSTOR. At City Tech our research and library instruction program starts up again tomorrow, and I’ll be interested to see how students react to the changes, too.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year my research partner and I are expanding our <a href="http://ushep.commons.gc.cuny.edu">qualitative study of student scholarly habits</a>, so this semester I'm taking one RT day a week for fieldwork. We spent some time over the summer working on a preliminary analysis of last year's data, and it's great to get back to collecting data and interviewing students again. Though my field days can be long and tiring it's completely fascinating to learn about students' lives at school and beyond.

Last year I collected data at my own college (City Tech), but this year I'm working at another CUNY school: City College. I expected that the surroundings and students would be different -- many of our programs at City Tech are unique in CUNY, and CCNY has grad students, while we don't at City Tech. But I hadn't anticipated the many other ways that fieldwork would be different this year.

In a sense I'm like a new student. I don't know where anything is, though posting fliers to recruit students helped me start to internalize the layout of the college. CCNY has a much bigger campus than City Tech, so at the beginning of the semester I constantly underestimated the amount of time I needed to get from one place to another. Sometimes the cafeteria is so crowded that it's hard to find a spot to eat lunch. I can't ever seem to find an outlet to charge my phone and netbook when I need it. And until I scored a guest wifi password last week I was (guiltily) jockeying with students to use computers in the library (I have trouble typing lengthy emails on my phone).

Like many CUNY students, my commute is long: 1+ hrs each way, whether I come from home or from work. I need to carry what sometimes seems like a ridiculous amount of stuff: reading material for the commute, notebook, consent forms and instructions for students, disposable cameras (sometimes), voice recorder, netbook, stapler, tape, lunch, water, jacket (and--perish the thought--sometimes it rains, so add an umbrella to the list). A colleague in the library has graciously offered to let me stash my outerwear at her desk when I'm up at City, but it's so different from last year, when I could meet students at my own desk.

As I've interviewed students I've found that I'm learning a lot from them that's not only great project data but also immediately useful to me. Where are the best bathrooms in the NAC Building? What's the quietest spot in the Cohen Library, esp. during the very crowded afternoon hours? What's the best food in the cafeteria? Where are the working electrical outlets?

It's interesting to consider my own experiences as project data. I've kept a research journal since last year so I can keep track of how things are going in the study. Last year it mostly included personal thoughts and notes about best practices for data collection method, but this year my journal could be an additional data source, too.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past 3 years librarians in many different libraries and countries around the world have collaborated on the <a href="http://librarydayinthelife.pbworks.com/">Library Day in the Life</a> project. Library workers blog, tweet, or post photos or videos to shine a light on what it is that we do all day. So far I've never participated -- the project takes place in January and July, at times that aren't during the regular CUNY semesters. I've always felt a little odd about joining in because I don't really consider the days this week to be typical for me.

But I've been quiet on this blog lately, so I thought this might be a good year to jump in. My plan was to chronicle yesterday, but then we got 15" (or was it 18?) of snow and the college closed (I took my kid to the park instead). So I'm going to try and reconstruct Wednesday's work happenings.

I should note that most weeks during the semester I teach at least a few classes or workshops for students or faculty, though that varies from week to week. I also spend time at the Reference Desk, though not as much as I teach. And the meetings tied to the semester calendar haven't started back up again yet either. So with that caveat...

On Wednesday I got into work at about 9:15, a little late for me (I had a routine doctor's appt). Usually I try to get to the library by 8-8:30 and spend the time before I officially clock in working on research + writing. I'm most focused in the morning and I find that I'm most productive (especially with difficult tasks like writing) if I stick to this habit. Doesn't always work out, but I'd say I keep to the plan more often than not.

Once my day officially started I triaged (answered, filed, deleted) email for about an hour. I also posted my handout on our staff wiki from the morning not-really-a-retreat we had in department the prior day. The theme of the non-retreat was productivity and connectivity, and we spent lots of time discussing email management techniques and how to use our new staff wiki for information we all need to access. I tried to use some of these email techniques this morning -- while I'm not an <a href="http://www.43folders.com/43-folders-series-inbox-zero">inbox zero</a> person I do try to keep my inbox relatively clear. I was bad about clearing out my sent mail folder last semester so I'm making a special effort to keep that manageable now.

Then I ran some errands around campus. First I went to media services to drop off a request for a media cart for our Web 2.0 Happy Hour faculty wine &amp; cheese program in March. Next I took the handout and worksheet to the campus copy center to be copied for our English Composition I library instruction sessions, a required component of that course. Finally I headed to the grants office to pick up and drop off forms, and checked in to confirm that a grant I'm submitting is complete.

I don't remember exactly when I had lunch, but it's usually no later than noon. Most often I bring my lunch and eat at my desk (boring, I know). Probably did a quick email check and looked at my Google Reader briefly, too.

Next I spent some time crunching data from the surveys we ask students in our English Comp I sessions to fill out. Since we'll be giving the survey to students during the Spring semester I didn't spend too much time running the numbers now, but I like to take a look before the new semester begins to see if there are any unusual comments. This time a student requested additional materials for help with using the library from home, which dovetails nicely with our plans to create more online video tutorials and guidelines.

I also checked in on our faculty feedback form responses from last semester's English Comp I sessions. Frustration in dealing with plagiarism was mentioned a couple of times. Unfortunately we don't have time to discuss plagiarism thoroughly in our sessions (they're only 75 minutes), so I emailed the instruction library faculty to pick our collective brains about strategies for helping to address the plagiarism issue.

After that I played around a bit with Zotero in advance of a faculty workshop I planned to co-teach this morning (but instead I was home with a sick kid -- too much sledding?). I'm a bit sheepish that I haven't used Zotero much in the past, and I've liked having an excuse to become familiar with it. I'm particularly excited about the collaborative features, which I think will come in handy for several projects I'm working on right now.

Next I made some coffee and prepped materials for our department curriculum committee to use to crossgrade student assignments as part of the collegewide assessment committee work I'm involved in. I'm on a few college and university committees and I genuinely enjoy most of my service work. It's been a nice way to learn more about how things work and helps keep me thinking about how the library fits in with the broader institutional mission.

After putting in a request to CIS for student email addresses for a pilot program we're trying this semester, it was back to email. I've been making the effort to keep my email to discrete chunks rather than checking constantly all day (I turned off notifications), but sometimes it's difficult.

I headed out for home shortly after 5 today, when the library closed. During the semester we're open later and I tend to stay a bit later, too. I try not to do too much work at home in the evenings, but I had a couple of time-sensitive things to get done this week. One of the students in <a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2010/05/28/this-is-not-a-library-skills-course/">my class</a> last semester asked me for a recommendation so I wrote that up for her. I also did some formatting tweaking on the <a href="http://ushep.commons.gc.cuny.edu/preliminary-results/">preliminary report</a> of last year's fieldwork that my research partner and I recently finished writing.

And that's about it for this day. Next week this will all change, but I love the busy beginning of the semester after the (relative) quiet of January.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month <a>this blog post</a> on the <em>New York Times</em> website made the rounds of my Twitter stream. Apparently evidence is growing that too much sitting can be harmful to our health, even for those who exercise regularly. I've been reading about the benefits of standing desks for a while now, and this was the push I needed to give it a try. Plus, that fat cat was really scary.

I can't justify buying a whole new desk, so I set to figuring out how to rig a temporary standing desk at home and at work. Home is somewhat easier because my primary computer is a laptop. We have lots of big, big books, and it turned out to be no trouble at all to pile a bunch of books on the dining room table and pop my computer on top. Here's what it looks like:

<a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/homedesk.jpg"><img src="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/homedesk.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="368" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-294" /></a>

But most weekdays I'm in the library, so I wanted to try a standing desk at work, too. Lots of books there, of course, but I can't just take books from the stacks to pile on my desk. Enter some extra metal journal holders that were sitting on the shelves in my office when I moved in last semester. As it happens, when you place 4 of them next to each other and turn them face down, they make a perfectly sized surface for my computer keyboard. Another two together fit the mousepad and mouse. Then I pull up my computer monitor and tilt it back slightly, and my temp standing desk for the office is all set:

<a href="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/workdesk.jpg"><img src="http://msmale.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/workdesk.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296" /></a>

In some ways the work setup is even better than the pile of books at home, because the keyboard is close to the edge of the journal holders which encourages me not to drop my wrists as I type.

Both setups are easy to put up and take down quickly, which is important because one thing I've learned over the past couple of weeks is that I'm not ready to move to a standing desk full time. Certain things are more difficult to do while standing, like eating while working or writing in longhand (though the latter would likely be easier on a real rather than temp standing desk).

But I've found that I really enjoy having the option to stand or sit while I work. Standing seems to make it easier for me to focus on certain tasks, like sustained work on a project. On the other hand, if I've been running around between meetings and teaching and other stuff, it's nice to sit down for a spell.]]></content:encoded>

I think if I worked primarily from home I would definitely invest in a real standing desk. But the work setup works surprisingly well.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago I was chatting with a nonlibrary colleague about the arrangement of books in our libraries. At my library (maybe at all CUNY libraries?) we shelve the bound volumes of journals and magazines alphabetically by title in their own area, right next to the unbound periodicals. But my colleague remembered that at the library he used when he was in graduate school the bound journals were shelved by call number in the stacks with the rest of the books. He appreciated the opportunity for serendipity that this arrangement allows: when searching for a book in the stacks you could easily stumble upon a journal you hadn't known about.

We started to speculate about using smartphones and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented reality</a> to virtually shelve the periodicals in the stacks in our own libraries. Wouldn't it be cool if you could walk up to a shelf, scan the call numbers with your phone's camera, and the list of journals and magazines in that call number range would pop up on your screen? I kept thinking about this later that day and spun it out even further. What if, in addition to periodicals, other information about the library's collections in a specific call number range could be displayed:

- books that are currently checked out, with their due dates (and a link to place a hold on the book)
- journals that are available in the library's article databases (and a link into the databases)
- ebooks in the library catalog (ditto link)
- books from other CUNY libraries
- video, audio, and other multimedia

That's a lot of information for a user interface to accommodate on a small screen. Maybe each type of item could be displayed in its own layer, and toggled on and off as desired? We could even get cute and display the information on a little book image, right down the spine.

I think what seems most attractive about this to me goes back to the notion of serendipitous discovery. Librarians talk lots about the possible loss of serendipity with the move to digital reading, and augmented reality or something similar could be one way to address this issue. 

And speaking of serendipity, not long after that conversation (and associated speculation) the news of an <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/awesome_augmented_reality_app_could_save_librarian.php">augmented reality shelfreading app</a> sped 'round the libraryverse. This app, developed at Miami University, scans a bookshelf and locates books that are out of call number order, making short work of an otherwise fairly dull library task.

<em>Then</em> I went to the ACRL National Conference last week, the biennial gathering of academic librarians, only to find that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> were everywhere, from posters (<a href="http://ushep.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2011/03/29/off-to-philadelphia/">including my own</a>) to presentations. QR codes are not new, of course, but this is the first time I've both used them (ask me how many poster URLs I snapped!) and thought about the ways that they could help folks find information in our libraries.

We might be closer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End"><em>Rainbow's End</em></a> than we think, at least in libraries.]]></content:encoded>
